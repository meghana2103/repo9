## How It Works

1. The user types a sentence describing how they feel.
2. The text is sent to OpenAI's API with a prompt like:  
   "Identify the emotion in the following sentence and give a kind response: 'I feel so tired and overwhelmed today.'"
3. GPT analyzes and responds with the emotion (e.g., "Sad") and a supportive message (e.g., "It's okay to feel tired sometimes. Take a breakâ€”you deserve it.")
4. The result is displayed in the UI.
